Airplane Time
=============

Set the departure and arrival time of your flight, then watch as the clock progresses at plane speed!

* If your flight leaves at 5:30pm from Reykjavik, and arrives in Seattle at 4:30pm, then time actually moves very slowly backwards the whole flight!
* If your flight leaves Seattle at 4:10pm, and arrives in Reykjavik at 6:10am the next day, then time moves very quickly!

You can use this app to see the real-time clock in the plane.

It's a progressive web app so it can be installed as a home screen icon and works offline!
